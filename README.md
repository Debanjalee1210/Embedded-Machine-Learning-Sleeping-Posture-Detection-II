# Embedded Machine Learning-Sleeping Posture Detection II
 Model training, inference and deployment -TinyML Kit

 In this project, you will use the IMU sensor unit embedded in the Arduino board to gather
sensor data including 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope, and 3-axis magnetometer
such that the data mimic various postures, and design and implement a machine learning
algorithm for real-time posture detection. You will implement the developed model on
the microcontroller.
